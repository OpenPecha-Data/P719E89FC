Aspiration towards Sukhāvatī
by Shamar Chökyi Wangchuk

emaho
Emaho!
di né nyima nub kyi chok
From here, over in the direction of the setting sun,
drangmé jikten galwé sar
In a place many countless worlds away,
namdak shyingkham dewachen
Lies the utterly pure realm of Sukhāvatī, 'the Blissful',
dé na dzokpé sangye chok
There resides the supreme and perfect Buddha,
tsé ö pak tu mepa shyuk
Boundless Life and Light.
gönpo dé la chaktsal lo
To that Lord and protector, I pay homage.
yitrul kunzang chötrin bul
I offer clouds of imagined gifts, just like Samantabhadra's.
tserab sakpé dikpa shak
I confess misdeeds accumulated over many lifetimes.
dro kün gé la jé yi rang
I rejoice in the virtuous actions of all beings.
chö kyi khorlo korwar kul
I request the turning of the Wheel of Dharma.
nya ngen mi da shyuk soldeb
I pray that you do not pass into nirvāṇa.
dak gi dü sum gé tsok kyi
And, through the virtues amassed in past, present and future,
di né tsé pö gyur ma tak
I pray that as soon as my life ends and I pass from here,
shying chok der kyé gön deshyin
I may be born in that sublime realm, and, like the Lord himself,
dak kyang dön nyi püntsok té
Perfectly achieve my own and others' aims—
ngepar nyi du drub dzé sol
Make this wish of mine come true, I pray!

This was spoken by the Karmapa holder of the Red Hat in response to the fine and ardent requests
of Karma Lodrö, the lama of Gina Monastery, and Drongpa Lama, who said there was a need
for brief aspiration prayer for Sukhāvatī that could be recited regularly.
